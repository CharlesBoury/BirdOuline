# BirdOutline
A little toy project to illustrate an Outline Shader for Unity Sprites

![toy](http://charlesboury.fr/lowrezjam/BirdOutline.gif)

It's based on a @RyanNielson  [Outline Shader](http://nielson.io/2016/04/2d-sprite-outlines-in-unity/).
It works on Sprites.

Choose between Interior, Exterior, or Both.
Last option is for corners. You can choose to have them, or not, by changing their alpha.
